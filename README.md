Animate is a mesh adaptation toolkit enabling users to anisotropically adapt a mesh based on a Riemannian metric framework with control over the shape, orientation and size of the resulting mesh elements. Animate is built for use with Firedrake and  strongly leverages PETSc DMPlex functionality. The implementation of metric-based mesh adaptation used in PETSc assumes that the metric is piece-wise linear and continuous, with its degrees of freedom at the mesh vertices.

For more information on Firedrake, please see:Â [Firedrake Website](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).

## Linux Installation

The following installation instructions assume a Linux or WSL operating system. The options below include the installation of a custom setup for Firedrake and PETSc from either a shell script or a Docker image. If Firedrake is already installed, please see instructions "To install Animate via `git clone`".

### To install Firedrake via shell script

Firedrake, along with PETSc, is required by the Animate package and is available for installation via a shell script.

Instructions:
- Download installation files either:
	-  manually from: or via `curl -O <filename>`
		- install/install_firedrake_custom_mpi.sh
		- install/petsc_options.txt
	- via curl:
		- `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyroteus/animate/main/install/install_firedrake_custom_mpi.sh`
		- `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyroteus/animate/main/install/petsc_options.txt`
-  Install firedrake and associated dependencies to a local environment via `source install_firedrake_custom_mpi.sh`
- Continue to follow the instructions below in "To install Animate via `git clone`" to complete the installation of Animate.

### To install Firedrake via Docker image

A Firedrake docker image exists and can alternatively be downloaded and installed before installing Animate. 

To install the Firedrake docker image:
- Pull the docker image: `docker pull jwallwork/firedrake-parmmg`
- Run the docker image: `docker run --rm -it -v ${HOME}:${HOME} jwallwork/firedrake-parmmg`

Please note, that by installing via a Docker image with `${HOME}` you are giving Docker access to your home space.

Continue to follow the instructions below in "To install Animate via `git clone`" to complete the installation of Animate.


### To install Animate via `git clone`
Installing Animate via cloning the GitHub repository assumes prior installation of Firedrake and its dependencies. For separate instructions for installing Firedrake please see: [Firedrake download instructions](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html).

To install Animate via `git clone`:
- Activate your local virtual environment containing the bespoke Firedrake installation and navigate to the `src` folder.
- from the main Animate GitHub, `git clone` the repository using HTTPS or SSH into the `src` folder
- `cd animate` and run `make install` to install Animate
- Execute the test suite to confirm installation was successful via `make test`
