# On-the-fly time-dependent mesh adaptation
# #########################################
#
# In this demo we consider the two-dimensional version of the mesh adaptation experiment
# presented in :cite:`Barral:2016`. The problem comprises a bubble of tracer
# concentration field advected by a time-varying flow.
# We will consider two different mesh adaptation strategies: the classical mesh
# adaptation algorithm, which adapts the mesh several times throughout the simulation
# based on the solution at the current time, and the metric advection algorithm, which
# advects the initial metric tensor along the flow in order to predict where to
# prescribe fine resolution in the future. Both algorithms are an example of
# *on-the-fly* time-dependent mesh adaptation algorithms, where the mesh is adapted
# before each subinterval of the simulation, as opposed to fixed-point iteration
# algorithms. Fixed-point iteration algorithms solve the equation of interest at each
# iteration, before adapting the mesh based on computed solutions at the end of each
# iteration. This clearly makes them effective at predicting where to prescribe fine
# resolution throughout the simulation, but implies substantial computational cost.
#
# We begin by defining the advection problem. We consider the advection equation
#
# .. math::
#   \begin{array}{rl}
#       \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}c)=0& \text{in}\:\Omega,\\
#       c=0 & \text{on}\:\partial\Omega,\\
#       c=c_0(x,y) & \text{at}\:t=0,
#   \end{array},
#
# where :math:`c=c(x,y,t)` is the sought tracer concentration,
# :math:`\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}(x,y,t)` is the background velocity field, and
# :math:`\Omega=[0, 1]^2` is the spatial domain of interest with boundary
# :math:`\partial\Omega`.
#
# The background velocity field :math:`\mathbf{u}(x, y, t)` is chosen to be periodic in
# time, and is given by
#
# .. math::
#   \mathbf{u}(x, y, t) := \left(2\sin^2(\pi x)\sin(2\pi y), -\sin(2\pi x)\sin^2(\pi y) \right) \cos(2\pi t/T),
#
# where :math:`T` is the period. At each timestep of the simulation we will update this
# field so we define a function that will return its vector expression. ::

# initialise the tracer concentration :math:`c_0 = c(x, y, 0)` to be :math:`1` inside
# a circular region of radius :math:`r_0=0.15` centred at :math:`(x_0, y_0)=(0.5, 0.65)`
# and :math:`0` elsewhere in the domain. Note that such a discontinuous function will

# diffusion. Numerical diffusion is necessary for numerical stability and for preventing
# oscillations, but it also makes the solution irreversible. The amount of difussion
# added is related to the grid PÃ©clet number :math:`Pe = U\,h/2D`: the coarser the mesh

# As we can see, the relative :math:`L^2` error is lower than the one obtained with the
# uniform fine mesh, even though the average number of vertices is more than 8 times
# smaller. This demonstrates the effectiveness of mesh adaptation, which we can also
# observe in the figure above. We see that final mesh has clearly been refined around
# the bubble at the beginning of the final subinterval and coarsened elsewhere.
#
# However, we also observe that the bubble has advected out of the fine resolution
# region by the end of the subinterval. This is a common occurence in time-dependent
# mesh adaptation, known as the *lagging mesh* problem, where the mesh is said to lag
# with respect to the solution.
# Ensuring that the bubble remains well-resolved throughout the simulation
# is not a trivial task, as it requires predicting where the bubble will be in the
# future. Earliest attempts at preventing the lagging mesh problem introduced a safety
# margin around the fine-resolution region. While potentially very effective, depending
# on the size of the margin, this approach is also likely to be inefficient as it may
# prescribe fine resolution in regions where it is not needed.
#
# For advection-dominated problems, as is the case here, a *metric advection* algorithm
# has been proposed in :cite:`Wilson:2010`. The idea is to still compute the metric
# based on the solution at the current time, but then to advect the metric along the
# flow in order to predict where to prescribe fine resolution in the future. By
# combining the advected metrics in time, we obtain a final metric that is
# representative of the evolving solution throughout the subinterval. We achieve this in
# the following function, where we solve the before-seen advection equation for each
# component of the metric tensor. ::

#
# The relative :math:`L^2` error of 31.30% is slightly lower than the one obtained with
# the classical mesh adaptation algorithm, but note that the average number of vertices
# is about 15% smaller. Looking into the final adapted mesh and concentration fields in
# the above figure, we now observe that the mesh is indeed refined in a much wider
# region - ensuring that the bubble remains well-resolved throughout the subinterval.
# However, this also means that the available resolution is more widely distributed,
# leading to a coarser local resolution compared to classical mesh adaptation.
#
# Let us now consider the implications and limitations of each approach. Firstly,
# given a high enough adaptation frequency (i.e. number of adaptations/subintervals),
# the lagging mesh problem can be mitigated with the classical mesh adaptation
# algorithm. This may end up being more computationally efficient than the metric
# advection algorithm, which requires solving the advection equation once more
# at each timestep, as well as potentially expensive metric computations.
# However, while increasing the mesh adaptation frequency would alleviate the mesh lag,
# doing so may introduce large errors due to frequent solution transfers between meshes.
#
# This is where the advantage of the metric advection algorithm lies: it predicts where
# to prescribe fine resolution in the future, and thus avoids the need for frequent
# solution transfers. We can assure ourselves of that by repeating the above simulations
# with ``num_adaptations = 5``, which yields relative errors of 61.06% and 36.86%
# for the classical and metric advection algorithms, respectively. Conversely,
# increasing the adaptation frequency to ``num_adaptations = 50`` yields again relative
# errors closer to one another. Note that the algorithms are identical if we adapt at
# every timestep. We summarise these results in the table below, noting also the average
# number of vertices, :math:`N_v`.
#
# .. table::
#
#    ======================= ============================== =====================================
#     Number of adaptations   Classical (avg. :math:`N_v`)   Metric advection (avg. :math:`N_v`)

#    ======================= ============================== =====================================
#
# Furthermore, the problem considered in this example is relatively well-suited for
# classical mesh adaptation, as the bubble concentration field reverses and therefore
# often indeed remains in the finely-resolved region. We can observe that in the below
# figure, at the subinterval :math:`(1.4 s, 1.6 s]`. This also means that the meshes
# adapted using classical and metric advection algorithms are qualitatively similar at
